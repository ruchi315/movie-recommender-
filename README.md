# Movie Recommendation System

   
I built a simple **movie recommendation system** using Python and Flask.  
You can select a movie from a dropdown list, and it will show **5 similar movies**.  

This project helped me learn **Python programming, working with datasets, machine learning basics, and creating a web interface**.

## Features

- Choose a movie from a dropdown menu.  
- Get 5 similar movies as recommendations.  
- Runs on a simple web page using Flask.  
- Easy to run locally and can be deployed online.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Flask

## How It Works

1. Preprocess movie dataset and compute similarity matrix.  
2. Users select a movie from the dropdown.  
3. The app finds the **most similar movies** and displays them as recommendations.  
4. Recommendations are generated instantly without retraining the model.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Python programming and data manipulation  
- Machine learning concepts: **content-based filtering**  
- Web development with **Flask**  
- End-to-end project workflow from **data preprocessing → model → web app**  
- Deployment readiness for platforms like **Render**

note: i was not able to upload similarity.pkl as it was exceeding the sie limit
